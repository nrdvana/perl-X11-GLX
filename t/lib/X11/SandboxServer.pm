=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to create a child process X server, primarily for testing
purposes.  Right now it only checks for Xephyr, but I'd like to expand it to
support others like Xnest or Xdmx or Xvfb.

This may eventually be officially published with this package, or made into
its own package.
